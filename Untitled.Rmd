#I'm going to try and learn how to use a NetCDF file. Oh boy. The data is from this website: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/yourrequests?tab=form. Let's install and load some packages (fields & ncdf4) Fields refuses to work, so oh well :( 
```{r}
library(ncdf4)
install.packages("spam", repo = 'https://mac.R-project.org')
```

#Loading in data & pulling separate variables
```{r}
durham_temperature <- nc_open("heat_data")

lat <-ncvar_get(durham_temperature,"latitude") 

lon <-ncvar_get(durham_temperature,"longitude") 

time <- ncvar_get(durham_temperature,"time")

temperature <- ncvar_get(durham_temperature,"t2m")
#10:18


```


```{r}
image.plot(lat,lon,temperature)
